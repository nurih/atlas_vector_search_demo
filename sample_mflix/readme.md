# Sample Mflix

The sample data was downloaded from MongoDB Atlas's sample data sets.

See https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/#std-label-available-sample-datasets for original source data information.


The encoded file [sample_mflix_gpt4all.movies.json](sample_mflix_gpt4all.movies.json "Encoded file") contains the same data, with an embedding vector added. The embedding was generated with the `Embed4All` module using the default model from `gpt4all`.
